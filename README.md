# SHM-materials

### Definition of SHM 
- [Structural health monitoring (SHM) is defined as the process of implementing a damage identification strategy for aerospace, civil, and mechanical engineering infrastructure.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/structural-health-monitoring#:~:text=Structural%20health%20monitoring%20(SHM)%20is%20defined%20as%20the%20process%20of%20implementing%20a%20damage%20identification%20strategy%20for%20aerospace%2C%20civil%2C%20and%20mechanical%20engineering%20infrastructure)


### Needs of SHM 
- Harsh environment 
  - [Existing bridge structures are subjected to various environmental and operational loads in daily operation. Influences of these external loads are unfavorable and prone to accelerate structural damage.](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29ST.1943-541X.0002535#:~:text=Existing%20bridge%20structures%20are%20subjected%20to%20various%20environmental%20and%20operational%20loads%20in%20daily%20operation.%20Influences%20of%20these%20external%20loads%20are%20unfavorable%20and%20prone%20to%20accelerate%20structural%20damage.)
- Extreme events 
  - [Besides, extreme events like earthquakes may also be encountered during bridge service life. Thus it is necessary to recognize structural condition timely to ensure safety.](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29ST.1943-541X.0002535#:~:text=accelerate%20structural%20damage.-,Besides%2C%20extreme%20events%20like%20earthquakes%20may%20also%20be%20encountered%20during%20bridge%20service%20life.%20Thus%20it%20is%20necessary%20to%20recognize%20structural%20condition%20timely%20to%20ensure%20safety.,-Traditionally%2C%20visual%20inspection)   
- Disadvantages of Visual Inspection 
  - labor-intensive
  - time-consuming
  - subjective results
   
### Application of SHM 
- [SHM techniques have been applied in bridges by installing structural health monitoring systems (SHMS) for almost 40 years and were increasingly applied in long-span bridges worldwide.](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29ST.1943-541X.0002535#:~:text=SHM%20techniques%20have%20been%20applied%20in%20bridges%20by%20installing%20structural%20health%20monitoring%20systems%20(SHMS)%20for%20almost%2040%C2%A0years%20and%20were%20increasingly%20applied%20in%20long%2Dspan%20bridges%20worldwide%20(Brownjohn%20et%C2%A0al.%202011%3B%20Ko%20and%20Ni%202005%3B%20Nagarajaiah%20and%20Erazo%202016).)
